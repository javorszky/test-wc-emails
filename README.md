# Test WC Emails

Sometimes you want to make changes to emails, and you need to see what the result of your changes are.

Manually triggering each email you changed is tedious.

NO MORE!

Use this plugin and the power of WP-CLI to trigger every single email on the appropritate objects of your choice and have the emails delivered right into your inbox!*

*<small>I recommend using something like MailHog to catch all emails locally while you work on them</small>

## Setup

1. Clone this repo
2. `composer install`
3. Activate.
4. ???
5. Test them juicy emails!
